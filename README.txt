CSE 241 submission 

My source code is in the NUMA folder, my main java file is titled isg224.java
My Manifest.txt and isg224.class and the jar files are in the isg224 folder.


Running my project is pretty simple, 
We enter integers correspondence	to the menu. 

I did interfaces for the property manager, tenant, and business manager interfaces

-Property manager can record visit data, record lease data, record move out.
-Tenants can check payment status on their lease, make payments, add dependents, plan move out,

Business managers displays all living tenants in a property, display how much income taxes need to be paid based on property, and how much income is being generated from each property. 

How certain inputs are validated for a Smooth first experience are structured.
